## introduction:

In response to the evolving needs of the Nablus Branch of the Engineers Union, we present a web application designed to redefine project management in the construction industry. The construction project supervision web application is designed to enable project supervisors to efficiently oversee the progress of construction projects.

Traditionally, project tracking has been tangled in the complexities of paper-based systems, presenting challenges in managing project files and organizing visits. Our innovative web application aims to transcend these limitations, offering a digital ecosystem where every project is meticulously documented, and every project visit is coordinated for comprehensive oversight.

## Objectives:

1.	Improve data analytics and reporting capabilities for better decision-making.

2.	Ensure mobile accessibility to enable on-site supervisors to access project data in the field.

3.	Establish a scalable and adaptable system for future project needs.

4.	Reduce the environmental impact by decreasing the need for paper-based documentation.

## Application Features and Description: 

The computerized system will include features such as project tracking and automated reporting. It will ensure that project data is accessible online, facilitating seamless communication and data retrieval.

## Tools and Resources:

### Integrated development environment (IDE): 
•	Visual Studio Code (VSC) <br>
•	Postman <br>

### Languages:

•	HTML 5 <br>
•	CSS <br>
•	BOOTSTRAP <br>
•	JavaScript (ES 6) <br>
•	PHP (API) <br>
•	MYSQL  <br>

### API Testing: 
•	Postman <br>

### Version control system:
•	Git, GitHub, Git flow <br>


## Challenge:

1.	Difficulty in communicating with non-programmers and explaining technical concepts to them.
2.	Dealing with a large amount of paper-based data that is challenging to transfer manually to a database.
